# assets/ (place your provided images here)

This project expects the reference images you provided to live inside the `assets/` folder.
Please copy the original files from your ZIP into `assets/` using the filenames below.

Recommended filenames (map these to your uploaded images):

- assets/hero.jpg        -> The landing hero background image (Reference: the purple page with "Experience a Bizarre Brew")
- assets/menu_full.jpg   -> The large menu image (portrait menu shot)
- assets/menu_section.jpg-> A cropped/sectional menu image (optional)
- assets/logo.png        -> The square JoJo's logo image

If your file names differ, either rename them to the above or update the <img> / CSS background paths in the .php files and style.css accordingly.

Note: No actual PHP server-side code is used — the files are plain HTML saved with a .php extension as requested.
