#📖 About The Project

JoJo's Bizarre Coffee is a full-stack web application developed for our Web Development 2 subject. It serves as an e-commerce platform for a fictional, anime-themed coffee shop.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in server-side scripting, database management, and dynamic content rendering.

🌟 Features

User Authentication: Secure registration and login system for customers and admins.

Dynamic Menu: Coffee and pastry items are fetched directly from the MySQL database.

Shopping Cart: Users can add items to their stand (cart) and manage quantities.

Order Management: Users can place orders, and Admins can view/process them.

Admin Dashboard: CRUD capabilities for managing products (Add, Edit, Delete coffee items).

Responsive Design: Looks great on Desktop and Mobile (even inside a Speedwagon Foundation vehicle).
